# Combined Documentation Example

An example Swift package that shows how to build and host combined documentation for more than one target

Using the experimental support for building combined documentation archives in the Swift DocC Plugin, this package built [its hosted combined documentation](https://d-ronnqvist.github.io/combined-documentation-example/documentation/outer/outerclass/) following the steps in the [Publishing to GitHub Pages documentation](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/publishing-to-github-pages) with the added `--enable-experimental-combined-documentation` flag.
